üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Looking at the current webpage, I can see it's a product page for wireless headphones. The task is to find reviewers who mention that the ear cups are small.

From the accessibility tree, I can see:
1. There is a "12 Reviews" link in the main section that leads to the reviews section
2. The page has review-related elements like "Add Your Review" link

My plan:
1. First, I need to navigate to the reviews section to see all the reviews
2. Then I need to examine each review to find mentions of ear cups being small
3. Identify and list the reviewers who made such comments

Since I can see there's a "12 Reviews" link that will take me to the reviews section, I should click on it to access the reviews. This seems like the most direct path to complete the task.
üõ†Ô∏è Generated code:
async def act(page):
    # Click on the "12 Reviews" link to navigate to the reviews section
    await page.get_by_role("link", name="12 Reviews").click()

‚è≥ Executing 1
üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Looking at the current page state, I can see that I successfully navigated to the Reviews section (indicated by the "Reviews (12)" tab being selected and expanded). However, I notice that what I'm seeing is the review submission form rather than the actual existing reviews.

The accessibility tree shows:
- A tabpanel for "Reviews (12)" that contains only a review submission form
- The form includes rating selection, nickname field, summary field, and review text field
- But I don't see any existing reviews displayed

This suggests that either:
1. The reviews are not visible in the current view
2. I need to scroll down to see the existing reviews
3. The reviews might be on a different section of the page

Since the task is to find reviewers who mention ear cups being small, I need to see the actual reviews, not just the submission form. Let me scroll down to see if there are existing reviews below this form.
üõ†Ô∏è Generated code:
async def act(page):
    # Scroll down to see if there are existing reviews below the review submission form

‚è≥ Executing 2
üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Perfect! Now I can see the actual reviews on the page. I need to carefully read through each review to find mentions of ear cups being small.

Looking at the visible reviews:

1. First review by jGonzo (Posted on 4/20/23):
This review mentions "my in-ear headphones on so loud it physically hurt" and discusses noise-cancelling features and gym use. It talks about "easier storage in my gym bag" and mentions the headphones being foldable. However, it doesn't specifically mention ear cups being small.

2. Second review by Michelle DavisMichelle Davis (Posted on 4/20/23):
This review mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them." This is directly relevant to the task - the reviewer is saying the ear cups are too small for adult ears and only work for small ears/kids.

I can see there are pagination controls at the bottom with links to "Page 2" and "Page Next", indicating there are more reviews to check. I should examine the second page as well to make sure I don't miss any reviews mentioning small ear cups.

From what I can see so far, Michelle DavisMichelle Davis is one reviewer who mentions that the ear cups/padding doesn't fit over adult-sized ears, essentially saying they're too small for adults.

Let me check the second page to see if there are more reviews mentioning small ear cups.
üõ†Ô∏è Generated code:
async def act(page):
    # Click on Page 2 to see more reviews
    await page.get_by_role("link", name="Page 2").click()

‚è≥ Executing 3
üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Looking at the current state of the reviews page, I can see that I'm now on Page 2 of the reviews. I can see two reviews displayed:

1. First review by Michelle Davis (Posted on 4/20/23):
This review mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them." This clearly indicates that the ear cups are too small for adult ears.

2. Second review by Amazon Customer (Posted on 4/20/23):
This review talks about "Terrible quality" and mentions returning headphones because they "do not wanna spend a lot of money for a four-year-old child however I can't blame the child this time for any defective condition because it's not even 30 days that we have the second pair of headphones." This doesn't specifically mention ear cups being small.

I can see pagination controls showing "1 2" which suggests there are only 2 pages of reviews total. Looking at my previous actions, I saw that on page 1 there was a review by Michelle Davis that mentioned ear cups being too small for adult ears. Now on page 2, I see the same review content again from Michelle Davis mentioning the same issue about ear cups being too small for adult ears.

I need to go back to page 1 to make sure I have all the reviews and compile the complete list. Let me check if there are more reviews by going back to page 1.

üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Looking at the current state of the webpage, I can see that I'm on the Reviews section of the product page and I can see several customer reviews displayed. I need to examine each review to find mentions of ear cups being small.

Looking at the visible reviews on this page:

1. First review by Jenna Kaufman (Posted on 4/20/23) with title "Great":
This review mentions battery life and charging but doesn't mention ear cups being small.

2. Second review by Joseph Brzezinski (Posted on 4/20/23) with title "Love these headphones":
This review mentions sound quality and connectivity but doesn't mention ear cups being small.

3. Third review by Catso (Posted on 4/20/23) with title "Too small, did not hold charge":
This review specifically mentions "Also they really are for people with very small ears" - this is a direct mention of the ear cups being too small for regular-sized ears.

4. Fourth review by Dibhms (Posted on 4/20/23) with title "Cup for ears very small":
This review explicitly states "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small - as such, they do very little to cancel any noise. Also, because they are so small, they tend to not be very comfortable to use for extended periods." This is a clear mention of ear cups being small.

I can see there are pagination controls at the bottom, so I need to check if there are more pages to review. However, based on what I can see on this page, I have found two reviewers who specifically mention ear cups being small:

1. Catso - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"
2. Dibhms - mentioned "Cup for ears very small" in the title and detailed that "for adult sized ears they are way too small"

I should scroll down to see if there are more reviews or pagination controls to check additional pages.

Looking at the current state of the page, I can see there are customer reviews displayed. I need to examine the reviews I can see to find mentions of ear cups being small.

From the reviews I can see:

1. jGonzo review (Posted on 4/20/23): This review mentions noise-cancelling and gym use but doesn't mention ear cups being small.

2. Michelle Davis review (Posted on 4/20/23): This review states "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them." This is clearly mentioning that the ear cups/padding are too small for adult ears.

I can see pagination controls at the bottom showing "1 2" and a "Page Next" link, indicating there are more reviews to check. I need to navigate to page 2 to see if there are any other reviews mentioning small ear cups.

Based on my previous actions, I recall seeing reviews from:
- Catso: mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"
- Dibhms: mentioned "Cup for ears very small" in the title and detailed that "for adult sized ears they are way too small"

Since I can see there are more pages of reviews and the pagination shows page 2 exists, I should check page 2 to make sure I capture all reviewers who mention small ear cups.

üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Based on my previous actions, I have thoroughly examined the reviews on both pages of this product. I can see that I'm currently on page 2 of the reviews, showing 2 reviews from Michelle Davis and Amazon Customer.

From my exploration of all the reviews across both pages, I have identified the following reviewers who specifically mention ear cups being small:

1. Michelle Davis (on both pages) - mentioned "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears üòÇüòÇüòÇ lol. But the kids really like them." This clearly indicates the ear cups are too small for adult ears.

2. From my previous actions, I also saw:
- Catso - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"
- Dibhms - had a review titled "Cup for ears very small" and detailed that "for adult sized ears they are way too small"

Since I've now reviewed both pages of reviews and have identified all reviewers who mention small ear cups, I can now provide the final answer. The task asks me to list reviewers who mention about ear cups being small, so I need to compile this list based on my findings.

For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them."

This clearly mentions that the ear cups/padding are designed for small ears and don't fit adult-sized ears.

2. Second review by Amazon Customer (1-star rating, Posted on 4/20/23):
This review is titled "Terrible quality" and discusses returning headphones but doesn't specifically mention ear cups being small.

2. A review by Amazon Customer titled "Terrible quality" but this doesn't mention ear cups being small.

I can see pagination controls at the bottom showing "1 2" which indicates there are more reviews on page 2. Based on my previous actions, I've already explored both pages and found the following reviewers who mentioned small ear cups:

1. Michelle Davis - In her review, she specifically stated: "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears üòÇüòÇüòÇ lol. But the kids really like them." This clearly indicates the ear cups are too small for adult ears.

2. Catso - In their review, they mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"

3. Dibhms - Had a review titled "Cup for ears very small" and mentioned "for adult sized ears they are way too small"

I can see from the current state that the Reviews (12) tab is already selected and expanded, and I can see the customer reviews section. The current page shows reviews by Michelle Davis and Amazon Customer, with pagination controls showing "1 2" at the bottom.

Since I have already thoroughly reviewed all the reviews across both pages in my previous actions and have identified all reviewers who mention ear cups being small, I don't need to take any further actions. The task asks me to list out reviewers who mention about ear cups being small, and I have found three such reviewers.

üí≠ Step-by-step reasoning:
Looking at the current state of the webpage, I can see that I'm on the Reviews (12) tab which is already selected and expanded. I can see customer reviews displayed on the page.

From the visible reviews, I can identify:

1. First review by Michelle Davis (Posted on 4/20/23): This review mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them." This clearly indicates the ear cups are too small for adult ears.

2. Second review by Amazon Customer (Posted on 4/20/23) titled "Terrible quality": This review discusses quality issues but doesn't mention ear cups being small.

I can see pagination controls at the bottom showing "1 2" which indicates there are more reviews on page 2. From my previous actions, I explored both pages and found reviewers who mentioned small ear cups:

- Michelle Davis: mentioned "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears"
- From my previous navigation, I also identified:
