You use them via Python function calls.\n   It is required to use the knowledge base function corresponding to an action if it exists.\n - Use relative `goto` when you can.\n\nYour task is List out reviewers, if exist, who mention about ear cups being small.\n\nYou are currently on a webpage titled '6S Wireless Headphones Over Ear,Noise Canceling Hi-Fi Bass Foldable Stereo Wireless Kid Headsets Earbuds with Built-in Mic, Micro SD/TF, FM for iPhone/Samsung/iPad/PC (Black & Gold)', with the url 'http://3.89.39.80:7770/6s-wireless-headphones-over-ear-noise-canceling-hi-fi-bass-foldable-stereo-wireless-kid-headsets-earbuds-with-built-in-mic-micro-sd-tf-fm-for-iphone-samsung-ipad-pc-black-gold.html'.\n\nConsider the following Accessibility Tree.\nThe accessibility tree is formatted like this:\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties] {{\n    [child1]\n}};\n[role] [\"name\"] [properties]; // no children\n\nHere is an example:\n<example>\n\narticle \"Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory Opens Its Gates\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle \"Hogwarts Begins Accepting Applicants for Class of 2029\" {{\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n... to select the first link, you can do (because name = case-insensitive substring match unless exact=True is supplied):\n\n```python3\nfirst_link = page.get_by_role(\"article\", name=\"Willy Wonka\").get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n</example>\n\nHere is another example:\n<example>\narticle {{\n    header \"How can I install CUDA on Ubuntu 22?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\narticle {{\n    header \"How do I install Docker?\";\n    link \"Share\";\n}};\n\n\n... to select the first link, you can do:\n\n```python3\npage.get_by_role(\"article\").filter(has=page.get_by_role(\"header\", \"How can I install CUDA\")).get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Share\")\n```\n\nHere, the .filter() is necessary to ensure that we select the correct `article`. This is especially important in cases where the parent\nelement doesn't include relevant criteria for identifying a child element.\n</example>\n\n\nTips about this tree:\n - If you see a node as a child of an `iframe`, you must use `page.frame(name=...)`, and *then* access the node (via `.get_by_role` or similar).\n - Some elements will require interaction via `.select_option()`. They will be labeled as such.\n   This is because they are HTML `<select>` elements, and thus cannot be interacted with via clicks.\n\nYou also have this library of Python functions available to you. Think carefully about whether you think these can be used in your code. If you conclude that you can use a function, then simply call it. These functions are all available as global variables.\n<functions>\n\n</functions>\n\nPlease think step by step and determine if further action needs to be taken. \nUse Playwright and complete the following Python function declaration:\n\nasync def act(page):\n    ...\n\nIf further action needs to be taken, provide a code snippet to interact with the page. \nPlease be noted that if you call an API that returns information retrieved from the website, you must return the result as-is, without any processing, filtering, or transformation. Do not attempt to interpret the data, extract values, or apply conditions. \nPlease return the API response results or print it out exactly as received. \n\n\nIf you have no more actions to perform, leave the `python_code` field blank and set the `terminate_with_result` field of your response to a non-empty string. Make sure that your terminate_with_result value is a direct response to the original task query.\n\nYour previous actions are:\n<previous_actions>\n<reasoning>\nLooking at the current webpage, I can see it's a product page for wireless headphones. The task is to find reviewers who mention that the ear cups are small.\n\nFrom the accessibility tree, I can see:\n1. There is a \"12 Reviews\" link in the main section that leads to the reviews section\n2. The page has review-related elements like \"Add Your Review\" link\n\nMy plan:\n1. First, I need to navigate to the reviews section to see all the reviews\n2. Then I need to examine each review to find mentions of ear cups being small\n3. Identify and list the reviewers who made such comments\n\nSince I can see there's a \"12 Reviews\" link that will take me to the reviews section, I should click on it to access the reviews. This seems like the most direct path to complete the task.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Click on the \"12 Reviews\" link to navigate to the reviews section\n    await page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"12 Reviews\").click()\n</code>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nLooking at the current page state, I can see that I successfully navigated to the Reviews section (indicated by the \"Reviews (12)\" tab being selected and expanded). However, I notice that what I'm seeing is the review submission form rather than the actual existing reviews.\n\nThe accessibility tree shows:\n- A tabpanel for \"Reviews (12)\" that contains only a review submission form\n- The form includes rating selection, nickname field, summary field, and review text field\n- But I don't see any existing reviews displayed\n\nThis suggests that either:\n1. The reviews are not visible in the current view\n2. I need to scroll down to see the existing reviews\n3. The reviews might be on a different section of the page\n\nSince the task is to find reviewers who mention ear cups being small, I need to see the actual reviews, not just the submission form. Let me scroll down to see if there are existing reviews below this form.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Scroll down to see if there are existing reviews below the review submission form\n    await page.evaluate(\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)\")\n</code>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nPerfect! Now I can see the actual reviews on the page. I need to carefully read through each review to find mentions of ear cups being small.\n\nLooking at the visible reviews:\n\n1. First review by jGonzo (Posted on 4/20/23):\nThis review mentions \"my in-ear headphones on so loud it physically hurt\" and discusses noise-cancelling features and gym use. It talks about \"easier storage in my gym bag\" and mentions the headphones being foldable. However, it doesn't specifically mention ear cups being small.\n\n2. Second review by Michelle DavisMichelle Davis (Posted on 4/20/23):\nThis review mentions \"For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them.\" This is directly relevant to the task - the reviewer is saying the ear cups are too small for adult ears and only work for small ears/kids.\n\nI can see there are pagination controls at the bottom with links to \"Page 2\" and \"Page Next\", indicating there are more reviews to check. I should examine the second page as well to make sure I don't miss any reviews mentioning small ear cups.\n\nFrom what I can see so far, Michelle DavisMichelle Davis is one reviewer who mentions that the ear cups/padding doesn't fit over adult-sized ears, essentially saying they're too small for adults.\n\nLet me check the second page to see if there are more reviews mentioning small ear cups.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Click on Page 2 to see more reviews\n    await page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Page 2\").click()\n</code>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nLooking at the current state of the reviews page, I can see that I'm now on Page 2 of the reviews.

It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them.\" This clearly indicates that the ear cups are too small for adult ears.\n\n2. Second review by Amazon Customer (Posted on 4/20/23):\nThis review talks about \"Terrible quality\" and mentions returning headphones because they \"do not wanna spend a lot of money for a four-year-old child however I can't blame the child this time for any defective condition because it's not even 30 days that we have the second pair of headphones.\" This doesn't specifically mention ear cups being small.\n\nI can see pagination controls showing \"1 2\" which suggests there are only 2 pages of reviews total. Looking at my previous actions, I saw that on page 1 there was a review by Michelle Davis that mentioned ear cups being too small for adult ears. Now on page 2, I see the same review content again from Michelle Davis mentioning the same issue about ear cups being too small for adult ears.\n\nI need to go back to page 1 to make sure I have all the reviews and compile the complete list. Let me check if there are more reviews by going back to page 1.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Go back to page 1 to see all reviews\n    await page.get_by_role(\"link\", name=\"Page 1\").click()\n</code>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nLooking at the current state of the webpage, I can see that I'm on the Reviews section of the product page and I can see several customer reviews displayed.

Third review by Catso (Posted on 4/20/23) with title \"Too small, did not hold charge\":\nThis review specifically mentions \"Also they really are for people with very small ears\" - this is a direct mention of the ear cups being too small for regular-sized ears.\n\n4. Fourth review by Dibhms (Posted on 4/20/23) with title \"Cup for ears very small\":\nThis review explicitly states \"The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small - as such, they do very little to cancel any noise. Also, because they are so small, they tend to not be very comfortable to use for extended periods.\" This is a clear mention of ear cups being small.\n\nI can see there are pagination controls at the bottom, so I need to check if there are more pages to review. However, based on what I can see on this page, I have found two reviewers who specifically mention ear cups being small:\n\n1. Catso - mentioned \"they really are for people with very small ears\"\n2. Dibhms - mentioned \"Cup for ears very small\" in the title and detailed that \"for adult sized ears they are way too small\"\n\nI should scroll down to see if there are more reviews or pagination controls to check additional pages.\n</reasoning>\n\n<code>\nasync def act(page):\n    # Scroll down to see if there are more reviews or pagination controls\n    await page.evaluate(\"window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)\")\n</code>\n\n---\n\n<reasoning>\nLooking at the current state of the page, I can see there are customer reviews displayed.

So your act() function should only represent NEW actions you want to take from here.\nIMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE LANGUAGE SETTINGS! Keep everything in English, even if you are in exploration mode.\n\nAdditionally if you click a link that you expect will take you away from the current page, make that the last action in act(). Don't\nwrite selectors that follow page navigations because you can't predict what they will be.\nMake sure to continue from the current state of the UI - not necessarily the initial state. For example, if a dropdown is open, you do not need to open it again, and things like that. If it appears that the website is in a loading state, you may call `await asyncio.sleep(5)` to wait for the page to load.\nMake sure you are aware of whether you have already completed the task or not.\n\nThe task is guaranteed to be possible to complete in an exact sense. Additionally, during each step, explicitly reason about the utility of each of the Python functions defined in the knowledge base with respect to the task at hand. When you are done, provide your final answer as a single result: for example, if asked for a number, simply return the number alone. If asked for the name of something, return only the name, and no additional text. Don't add any extra text to `terminate_with_result` beyond your answer. Do not overcomplicate the task; do what it asks for, and nothing more.\n\nDo not interact with the Advanced Reporting tab if you are using Magento Admin.\n",
